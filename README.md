# Advent of code
## What is aoc?
Advent of code is a daily challenge lastin through the advent.  
See: http://adventofcode.com/ for more informations.  
There is also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) where people are posting and discussing their solutions.

##What is my strategy?
I am not participating with the goal to get as many points as possible. I will probably miss quite a lot of days and post  
my solutions rather late in the day. My main goal is to get more familiar with interesting languages and to improve my coding  
skills in general.

##What languages am I using and why?
I will mainly be using:
- **elixir**  
I chose Elixir because I really like the language so far and want to improve my skills. 
Also I have a use case requiring the things that elixir excels in. 
- **python3**    
It's a language that is just fun to write in. I also need practice.
- **perl maybe?**    
Anything related to heavy text processing is probably going to end up being written in perl

##Feedback
If any scripts look like a huge mess it's probably because I just rushed them and didn't have time to look over them.  
I will try to revisit them and do some cleanup at some point. Feel free to give me feedback on my solutions if you see me  
posting in the subreddit. I appreciate every advice given to me.
